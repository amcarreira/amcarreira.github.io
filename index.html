                <h3> Crossed Sabers Ski & Board </h3>
                <p> Hardgoods Tech: <br> 
                        As a hardgoods tech, my job was to merchandise, sell, and maintain skis and snowboards. Customers would see a salesman, but I would also tune up and fix customers' skis and snowboards.</p>
                <h3> Humphrey's Building Supply </h3>
                <p> Inside Sales, Yard Labor, Delivery Driver: <br>
                        I have worked at Humphrey's since my senior year in high school. During the summer I work 40+ hours a week. With that much time in one company, they have given me opportunities at many positions. A typical day consists of starting inside selling product, then going outside to help customers find the product and load it in their vehicle, and potentially delivering the products for them. </p>

                <p> Tour Guide: <br> My responsibilities as a Bridgewater State University Tour Guide included greeting prospective students and introducing them to college. This position improved my customer service skills. </p>
